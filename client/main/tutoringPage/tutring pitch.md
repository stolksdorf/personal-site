# Tutoring




### Coding Bootcamp
You've tried to teach yourself some coding before, but you just can't seem to stick with it. Having a personalized plan and homework (?) and work towards a end project that _you_ are excited about I believe is key. 

CS degrees have a ton of theory that usually never shows up in th workplace. I can help you learn the skills to hit the ground running. 

- Writing modular and sustanable code
- Using git and source control best practices
- Project planning and execution
- How to do code reviews and unit testing
- Cutting edge web technologies: Node, React, advanced CSS animations, isomorphic apps


### Product development
Have an idea for a great product or app? I can help you flesh it out, guide you on developing the MVP, how to collect user feedback, and how to quickly iterate on your idea to see if you can find a market fit. 

I've helped dozens of small companies do this.

- User testing
- Developing MVPs
- How to do product research
- Common pitfalls of new apps and companies


### Workflow automation
You know how powerful programming can be, but you want to use it to improve your current career, not build a new one. We can work on tactics to automate common workflows at your job. 

I can introduce you to several tools and techniques I have used to streamline tasks in my career to become more productive and to get more out of your team. 

- IFTTT and Zapier
- Autohotkey
- Coda.io
- Multicursor editing
- Mechanical Turks
