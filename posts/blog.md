# Why `pico-flux`?



Data is hard in web apps



I have found the best way to scale your project is to reduce the amount of knowledge that a developer _needs_ to know to implement any feature.
	- Discrete parts, roles, and functions
	- Intutive data structures, and expected results


Code maturation


## What about `redux`?

Redux is a design paradigm that allows any type of webapp be fit within redux's idelogoy. This is comforting, because if you have leraned/weorked in any redux system, moving to a new one will be familar and you can become productive.

The co-developer of Redux has a good article outlining that [You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367).

I've tried to convert several of my apps over to redux to learn the tool, and I've found that redux makes very hard problems into hard problems, and simple problems into hard problems.




## Code Maturation

Code Maturation is the concept of writing code that is either easy to improve later or is easily removed and replaced. It embodies the idea that your code will mature as your team understands the problem spaces better, or the requirements of the project change overtime.
